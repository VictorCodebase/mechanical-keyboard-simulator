## Usage

In case you choose to clone the repo and run it in your editor, run python main.py in your console.  
If you get any errors, ensure you're in the root folder and all dependercies are already installed.

If you use the installer, everything should be fairly obvious.  
follow through the installation process. Proceed to open the software  

Please expect some warnings about the author being unknown. I dont know how to get authentication certificates yet, this will probably be fixed in a future update

The application is currently a console application (expect updates). No interactions are needed in this very basic version 1.1.2-alpha  
Feel free to leave it to do its thing whilst in background.
